                    <p class="about-text">Hello and welcome to my website. I am a creative and curious person who enjoys video games, drawing, and photography. I have always been fascinated by the power of technology and how it can transform our lives. That's why I am currently learning web hosting, development (lua and python), and other skills that can help me create amazing online experiences. On this website, you will be able to see some of my photos that capture my vision of the world, as well as some of my projects that showcase my coding abilities. If you want to get in touch with me, feel free to visit the contact page and send me a message. I would love to hear from you and collaborate on exciting ideas. Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy my website.</p>
